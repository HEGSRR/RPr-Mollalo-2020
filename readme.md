## Abstract

Mollalo et al. (2020) investigated county-level variations of COVID-19 incidence across the continental United States using spatial lag and spatial error models to investigate spatial dependence as well as geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multiscale GWR (MGWR) models to locally examine spatial non-stationarity. The original analyses are retrospective and use observational data collected from federal and other public sources. Although not publicly available, we were able to obtain the original data based on the authors's description. However, the analysis code was not made available.
